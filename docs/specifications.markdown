This is an overview of the specifications of kNOw SIGN that we aimed to build:

|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| The main model should run as an independent application on the Raspberry Pi | 
| For the input, the model should use a camera to detect the hand from a video feed | 
| For the output, the predicted signs must be shown as text on an OLED screen | 
| The whole setup should have a simple and minimalistic approach for the ease of the common user |

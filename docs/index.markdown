  This is a project completed by a group of students at University of Glasgow that utilizes real-time and efficient programming to help mute and deaf by establishing two-way communication channel with normal people who have never studied sign language.




According to the study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015, the deaf and mute constitutes about 5% of the world's population which approximately 70 million. But effective communication is a hindrance for this community in the real world. And the WHO predicts that by 2050 nearly 2.5 billion or 1 in 4 people will have some degree of hearing loss. The report notes that the use of sign language and its interpretation can further improve access to communication and education for those with hearing loss. A serious impediment for this community is the limited availability of written material and sign language interpreters at health services. It is said that millions benefit from the advancements in this field but their use is still far too limited.

Hence, our goal was to create a system that aids in effective communication and to be the voice of the unheard. The most popular sign language in use is the American Sign Language(ASL). We incorporated a system that executes real-time ASL recognition and reproduces it onto a LED display as text. It utilizes Pi camera (V2.1) for hand detection attached to Raspberry Pi 4B which acts as a PC. We aim this product to be an inexpensive alternative of other services while simultaneously realizing the objective using fast and efficient deep learning algorithm. Furthermore, the system has a compact and portable design considering the wearable comfort of the user. 

Further development in this work would include incorporating other types of sign languages and integrating a text to speech design.
